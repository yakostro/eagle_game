## Obstacles System (High Level)

### Purpose
Create readable, varied hazards that pace the run, teach spatial awareness, and host nests where intended.

### Types and Roles
- Mountain: ground silhouette; can host nests on ledges.
- Stalactite: ceiling hazard; no nests.
- Floating Island: mid-air platform; may host nests.

### Variants
- Each type supports multiple visual/collision variants.
- Mountains: three variants with unique nest placements.

### Spawning Model
- One spawner controls the global mix using weights per type.
- Fixed base cadence with slight randomness.
- Difficulty increases by shortening the interval.

### Movement and Cleanup
- All obstacles move left at the world/eagle speed for cohesion.
- Remove obstacles once they fully leave the screen.

### Nest Integration
- Nests only appear on obstacles that include a `NestPlaceholder` point.
- Nest timing uses “skip N obstacles” logic; N grows over time for difficulty.
- The nest is parented to the obstacle and positioned at its placeholder.

### Scene Standards (per obstacle)
- Single physics root with sprite, collision, and optional `NestPlaceholder`.
- Visuals: enter from the right cleanly; scale consistent with the eagle/world.
- Collisions: simple and forgiving over pixel-perfect accuracy.

### Difficulty Progression
- Increase pressure by:
  - Slightly higher spawn frequency.
  - Rarer nest appearances (larger N).
  - Richer variant mix (visual novelty over raw hardness).

### QA Acceptance
- Spawn mix matches intended weights.
- Obstacles scroll smoothly and delete off-screen.
- Nests only appear on eligible obstacles and at the intended spots.
- Collisions feel fair; silhouettes match enough to be readable.
- Variants show correctly with their unique nest placements.

## Prompt for Coding Agent

- Goal: Integrate real mountain art using three distinct variants, each with its own nest placement, and plug them into the existing obstacle and nest systems.
- Decision (Conceptual):
  - Make three separate mountain scenes (one per variant), each with proper sprite, collision, and a single `NestPlaceholder` where chicks should be.
  - Update the obstacle spawner to select randomly among these mountain scenes when it decides to spawn a “Mountain” (keep current nest flow intact).
  - Do not change the nest system logic; it should keep attaching to `NestPlaceholder` on the spawned obstacle.

- Deliverables:
  - Three mountain variant scenes with final art and validated nest spots.
  - Spawner accepts multiple mountain scenes and chooses one at spawn time.
  - Short playtest pass confirming: spawn variety, correct nest placement, smooth movement, and cleanup.
